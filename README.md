# Augsburg Neighbourhood Map
===============================

## Description

Made for the Udacity Frontend-Nanodegree, in this project you will see a map of Augsburg (Bavaria, Germany). This map is included via the Google Maps API. Important or interesting places are marked.

## Search box

As you can see, depending on your device, there is a search bar on the right hand side or - on small (mobile) screens - on the bottom of the page. With this search, it is possible to filter the shown markers as well as the results in the search box.

## Click on the markers

On click, the markers will show what is located there (for example town hall Augsburg) and also three related articles which you can find on wikipedia. The content is automatically filled via the wikipedia API. So it is possible for you to automatically get the best fitting results depending on the location you are looking for and straight get to the matching wikipedia article just by clicking on them.
